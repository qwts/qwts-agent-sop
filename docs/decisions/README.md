# Engineering decisions (ENG series)

Durable records for decisions that span **more than one repository**.

## What belongs here

A decision belongs in this series when it applies across repos, or when it has
no single owning repo:

- Tooling and quality-enforcement direction (linters, static analysis, CI gates)
- Conventions expected to hold in every repo (versioning, commit style, labels)
- Where things live — decision homes, documentation layout, tracking tools
- Language and platform direction affecting more than one project

## What does not

Anything owned by one repository stays in that repository. `qwts/photos` keeps
its own `ADR-NNNN` series in its wiki; a decision about photos' renderer, IPC
contract, or test strategy is a photos ADR, not an ENG record.

The test: **if exactly one repo would have to change, it is not an ENG record.**

## Numbering

`ENG-NNNN`, zero-padded. A new record's number **is its originating GitHub issue
number** ([ENG-0035](ENG-0035-issue-derived-record-numbers.md)): file the
issue-first issue this series already requires, then name the record after it —
issue #35 → `ENG-0035`. GitHub allocates issue numbers atomically and never
reuses them, so numbers are collision-free and no two open PRs can claim the
same one. Numbering is therefore sparse and non-consecutive, not `+1` — that is
expected. Records ENG-0001–0016 predate the rule and keep their sequential
numbers. docs-gov enforces the mapping and rejects duplicate numbers.

The prefix is deliberately distinct from photos' `ADR-NNNN` so that a citation
is never ambiguous about which series and which home it refers to.

## Format

Short. Context, the decision, why, and consequences — including the ones you did
not like. A record that lists no downside is not finished.

Status is one of `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Superseded by ENG-NNNN`. Records are
never deleted or rewritten after acceptance; supersede them instead, so the
reasoning trail survives.

Every record is issue-first ([ENG-0013](ENG-0013-issue-first-provenance.md)):
an `**Issue:**` header field cites the GitHub issue that holds the why and the
discussion. Records predating the rule carry
`predates issue-first (ENG-0013)`. docs-gov enforces the field.

## Review lens

Every record is reviewed against the priority order of
[ENG-0012](ENG-0012-decision-priority-order.md): **security → compliance →
agentic development → human developers**. The order settles conflicts between
principles; it does not waive the lower priorities.
