# ENG-0004: Centralize shared CI/CD in this repository

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-07-19
**Issue:** predates issue-first (ENG-0013)

## Context

`qwts/photos` and `qwts/image-trail` are two instances of one engineering
template. Their CI is near-identical, not coincidentally similar:

- Same script taxonomy: `lint:package`, `lint:new-files`, `lint:cycles`,
  `lint:dead`, `lint:types`, `format:check`, `test:cov`, `coverage:summary`,
  `test:stories:ci`, `test:e2e`, a changeset gate, and an interop-contract check.
- Same `ci.yml` job skeleton: `changes` (path filter) → `ci` → an E2E lane
  behind a stable `E2E gate`, with the same draft-skip, `merge_group`, and
  per-SHA concurrency logic.
- Same process-tree guard (`scripts/run-guarded.mjs`) and the same
  ratcheting-floor philosophy.

photos' `ci.yml` is 411 lines, image-trail's is 319; the difference is
photos' extra lanes (i18n, licenses, a11y budget, gh-pages report), not a
different design. The two have already drifted — the same fix must currently be
written twice, and more repos are coming (cartograph, mobile ports).

## Decision

Shared CI/CD lives in this repository as **reusable workflows**
(`workflow_call`) and **composite actions** under `.github/workflows/` and
`.github/actions/`, consumed by each repo as:

```yaml
uses: qwts/playbook-software-engineering/.github/workflows/<name>.yml@v1
```

**Pinning: a moving `@v1` major tag**, consistent with how these repos already
pin third-party actions (`actions/checkout@v7`). Logic changes propagate to all
consumers with no per-repo edit; breaking changes go to `@v2`. The safety
condition is non-negotiable: **this repo runs its own CI that exercises the
reusable workflows before the `v1` tag is moved.** Without that gate, a bad push
breaks every consumer's CI at once — the central risk this pinning choice
accepts.

Rejected: pinning consumers to an exact SHA/tag with Renovate auto-bump. It is
safer, but reintroduces a per-repo bump PR — partially the maintenance this
decision exists to remove. The test-gated moving tag keeps the single-edit
benefit while containing the blast radius.

## Scope and phasing

Two phases, not a big-bang migration.

1. **Greenfield generic gates first.** Dependency scanning (`osv-scanner`) and
   secret scanning (`gitleaks`) — gates *neither* repo has yet. Build as
   reusable workflows, wire both repos in. No migration risk; proves the
   mechanism, the pinning strategy, and the playbook-side CI end to end.
2. **The shared skeleton, only after phase 1 validates.** Extract the common
   `changes` / `ci` / `E2E gate` structure into a reusable workflow that
   consumers parameterize (which lanes, which paths). Higher value, higher risk.

## Consequences

- A CI fix is written once and reaches every repo — the maintenance win.
- Coupling is now real: a defect in a shared workflow can break every consumer
  simultaneously. The playbook-side CI is the mitigation and is mandatory, not
  optional.
- This repo becomes CI-load-bearing for others. It must itself stay green and
  have its own dependencies clean — note the open Dependabot alerts on its
  markdownlint tooling; a CI-hub repo cannot ship with an unpatched toolchain.
- The check **scripts** (`scripts/*.mjs`) still live per-repo. Sharing those is a
  separate, larger step (a shared npm package) and is explicitly out of scope
  here; reusable workflows can call a repo's own scripts by convention.
- Repo-specific lanes (photos' i18n/a11y, image-trail's version-policy/artifacts)
  stay in each repo. Centralization covers the common substrate, not everything.

## Re-homing of prior follow-ups

- **Dependency and secret scanning** (noted absent in [ENG-0002](ENG-0002-static-analysis-direction.md)) → phase 1 of this decision.
- **CI reporting the last failure, not the first** (a masking bug found during #565: a failed test in an `&&`-chained lane surfaced as a coverage-floor error) → a property to fix in the phase-2 shared skeleton.
- **`max-lines-per-function` set to `warn`, never enforced** → *not* this decision. That is ESLint config, shared via a config package, a different mechanism. Tracked separately so it is not miscategorized as CI.

## Amendment — 2026-07-22: canonical consumption path after repo rename

The repository was renamed from `qwts/playbook-software-engineering` to
`qwts/playbook-engineering`
([#12](https://github.com/qwts/playbook-engineering/issues/12)), so the
canonical form of the consumption path in the decision is:

```yaml
uses: qwts/playbook-engineering/.github/workflows/<name>.yml@v1
```

GitHub's rename redirect covers git operations and web links but **not
Actions**: per
[GitHub's renaming documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/renaming-a-repository),
calls to an action or workflow hosted by a renamed repository are not
redirected and fail with `repository not found`. Any consumer whose `uses:`
line still names the old repo must migrate it to the canonical path — this is
a required edit, not an optional cleanup. The pinning model and the CI-gated
`v1` tag are otherwise unaffected. The original snippet above is left as
written, per the rule that accepted records are amended, not rewritten.

## Amendment — 2026-07-31: lifecycle scheduling and trusted actors

Shared CI now includes the execution contract, not only reusable implementation
pieces. Every governed repository follows the
[CI execution policy](https://github.com/qwts/qwts-agent-sop/blob/8e9b32fba1dad1147d36c5f0a11cca1fc0a7535a/docs/reference/ci-execution-policy.md): draft PRs start no
Actions jobs and agents run lint/format/type/unit checks locally before marking
ready; an agent may manually run the complete suite for the final feature SHA;
ready PRs and ready updates reuse that evidence only for the exact SHA and
otherwise run every existing complete-suite gate; and an already-validated
merged SHA receives only a short
post-merge check. A merged SHA without complete-suite evidence falls back to
every gate. PR concurrency cancels obsolete runs, while one stable `CI` gate
prevents conditional expensive jobs from stranding branch protection.

Exact-commit validation uses rebase-only merges with the PR branch required to
be current. Merge queue is excluded because its `merge_group` workflow is
initiated by a GitHub-owned actor, which the trusted-actor policy refuses.

The repository-level GitHub Actions Policy is the primary execution boundary.
Only `qwts`, `chores-dumb[bot]`, `dependabot[bot]`, and the registered
`qwts-*-agent[bot]` Apps may initiate workflows. `github-actions[bot]`, other
third parties, and public-fork actors are refused before a runner starts.
Manual dispatch is limited to diagnostics, release recovery, workflow testing,
explicit reruns, and exact-SHA preflight validation before PR promotion. This
amendment changes when agreed validation runs; it does not remove docs-gov,
CodeQL, Storybook, E2E, smoke, or repository-specific security and compliance
gates.

Changesets and equivalent version-package PRs follow the same lifecycle. Their
generated version commit receives one complete-suite ready-PR validation;
version-cut automation does not dispatch a duplicate suite. Tag and release
jobs prove that their exact source commit has that successful evidence, then
run only release-specific version/provenance, artifact build, packaging,
signing, notarization, integrity, and packaged-mode smoke checks. Missing
evidence fails closed or requires an explicit complete-suite recovery run
before publication.

## Amendment — 2026-07-31: queue-validated `MERGE` commits

The rebase-only exclusion above is superseded. Governed default branches use
GitHub's required merge queue with merge method `MERGE`, `ALLGREEN` grouping,
one candidate build at a time, and one PR per merge. Ready-PR validation still
proves the reviewed head, but queue entry creates a new `merge_group` SHA from
current `main`; every agreed complete-suite gate runs on that exact candidate.
A successful queue run is the evidence reused for the short post-merge lane.
If the merged SHA lacks that evidence, `main` still fails safe by running the
complete suite.

The Actions Policy allows the `merge_group` event but does not add a new actor.
Both `github.actor` and `github.triggering_actor` remain restricted to `qwts`,
`chores-dumb[bot]`, `dependabot[bot]`, and registered active agent Apps. Public
forks remain ineligible: accepted changes move to a repository-owned branch
before validation or queue entry.

Rollout is staged so enabling the queue cannot strand a required check. First,
the repository's stable CI workflow gains `merge_group: checks_requested` and
the Actions Policy allows that event. Next, the ruleset requires the queue. A
pilot PR must prove the actual queue actor, the stable `CI` and retained check
contexts, the exact queue SHA, and the post-merge evidence handoff before the
same settings are applied to the rest of the governed fleet.

## Amendment — 2026-08-01: native queue pushes and preview actor policy

This amendment resolves
[#120](https://github.com/qwts/playbook-engineering/issues/120).

The native queue attributes its default-branch push to
`github-merge-queue[bot]`. The action authorizes it only when both actor fields
match on a `push` to `refs/heads/main`; every other event remains unauthorized.

GitHub's workflow-execution-protections preview cannot select the merge-queue
bot or express this event-scoped exception. Its actor restriction is disabled;
a repository role would authorize unrelated writers. Governed repositories
retain the immutable actor check, external-contributor approval with a
never-approve fork policy, read-only default token, action-source restrictions
and SHA pinning, required checks, and protected-branch review and queue rules.
Direct non-CI entrypoints run the action in authorization-only mode first.

Advanced CodeQL remains the lifecycle implementation rather than an actor-policy
workaround: its callable workflow follows draft, ready, queue, and post-merge
scheduling and preserves the required default-branch scan.

## Amendment — 2026-08-01: rollout portability and release semantics

The lifecycle is now owner-aware: organization-owned repositories use the
native queue, while user-owned repositories use strict checks, governed branch
updates, and exact-SHA fallback validation without changing their merge methods.
Required contexts bind to their actual publishers. Release lanes share semantic
Changesets output, and privileged writes share the Client ID/private-key
credential boundary. The existing PR concurrency contract remains unchanged.
The [CI policy](https://github.com/qwts/qwts-agent-sop/blob/8e9b32fba1dad1147d36c5f0a11cca1fc0a7535a/docs/reference/ci-execution-policy.md) and
[rollout checklist](https://github.com/qwts/qwts-agent-sop/blob/8e9b32fba1dad1147d36c5f0a11cca1fc0a7535a/docs/reference/governed-ci-rollout.md) define these controls.

## Amendment — 2026-08-02: source inputs and generated release projections

This amendment resolves
[#134](https://github.com/qwts/playbook-engineering/issues/134). In
`qwts/overlook#870`, commit `260fa140` applied one repository's Changesets
presence check to every complete suite. A generated Version packages PR then
failed after its reviewed Changesets had been intentionally consumed into
`package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`. Retaining an empty Changeset only masked the
defect until automation regenerated the branch.

The decision: **release-input requirements belong to a repository's own
contract, not to the shared lifecycle, and a generated release projection is a
distinct lifecycle object from the source PR that fed it.** Governed CI
classifies a projection only from reviewed configuration and GitHub-owned
identity, and exempts it from one thing — retaining inputs it was designed to
consume. Every other gate, including exact-SHA CI, stable contexts, Advanced
CodeQL, reviews, version consistency, packaging, signing, provenance, and
release integrity, applies to it unchanged.

The operational contract is in the
[CI policy](https://github.com/qwts/qwts-agent-sop/blob/8e9b32fba1dad1147d36c5f0a11cca1fc0a7535a/docs/reference/ci-execution-policy.md); per-repository dispositions
are in the
[release-lifecycle fleet handoff](https://github.com/qwts/qwts-agent-sop/blob/8e9b32fba1dad1147d36c5f0a11cca1fc0a7535a/docs/reference/governed-ci-release-lifecycle-fleet.md).

## Amendment — 2026-08-22: pinning superseded by immutable releases

The moving `@v1` tag is retired by
[ENG-0279](ENG-0279-immutable-releases-and-repo-lockfiles.md): consumers pin
exact immutable releases, bumped by bot-authored align PRs. Everything else
above stands, per amend-don't-rewrite.

## Amendment — 2026-09-14: renamed to `qwts/dev-steward`

Renamed again ([#355](https://github.com/qwts/dev-steward/issues/355)); the
canonical consumption path is now
`uses: qwts/dev-steward/.github/actions/<name>@<reviewed-sha>`. As in
2026-07-22, GitHub's redirect does not cover Actions, so a `uses:` naming the
old repository fails. Existing records keep the old name.

## Amendment — 2026-09-14: renamed to `qwts/agent-sop`

Renamed a third time, the same day, to match the project's own name and
domain (agentsop.ai) rather than a role word
([#355](https://github.com/qwts/dev-steward/issues/355)); the canonical
consumption path is now
`uses: qwts/agent-sop/.github/actions/<name>@<reviewed-sha>`. The redirect
rule above applies unchanged. Existing records keep their names.

## Amendment — 2026-09-15: home moves to `qwts-agent-ci`; pins are commits

[ENG-0355](ENG-0355-static-router-one-pointer-pinned-capabilities.md) moves
the shared CI mechanism out of this repository into `qwts/qwts-agent-ci`:
the composite actions, the CI policy classifier, the runtime budgets, the
pin-reachability check, and `release-lifecycles.json`. The canonical
consumption path is now
`uses: qwts/qwts-agent-ci/.github/actions/<name>@<commit>`, and the
"this repository's CI passes first" rule applies in that repository.
[ENG-0282](ENG-0282-immutable-pins-recorded-selection-no-aligner.md)
replaces the 2026-08-22 amendment above: consumers pin exact commits
directly, with no release and no aligner. Everything else stands.
The CI reference documents this record links at their last revision here are maintained in that repository: [CI execution policy](https://github.com/qwts/qwts-agent-ci/blob/3a5617b287d922e37f262210a1d8750d8217b56d/docs/ci-execution-policy.md), [rollout checklist](https://github.com/qwts/qwts-agent-ci/blob/3a5617b287d922e37f262210a1d8750d8217b56d/docs/governed-ci-rollout.md), [release-lifecycle fleet handoff](https://github.com/qwts/qwts-agent-ci/blob/3a5617b287d922e37f262210a1d8750d8217b56d/docs/governed-ci-release-lifecycle-fleet.md).
