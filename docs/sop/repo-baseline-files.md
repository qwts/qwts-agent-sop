# SOP: Repository baseline files

**Scope:** every `qwts` repository. **Model:** [ENG-0008](../decisions/ENG-0008-shared-sop-inheritance.md) —
inherit by default, vary by explicit delta.

## Required in every repo (mandatory — extend, don't drop)

| File | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `README.md` | What it is, how to run it, where deeper docs live. |
| `LICENSE` | Exactly this filename. Licensing is deliberately per-repo (MIT, PolyForm NC, proprietary, Apache-2.0 all in use); *absence* is the only violation. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Canonical agent context per [ENG-0006](../decisions/ENG-0006-agentic-primitives-governance.md). Vendor instruction files and harness rules live in the user directory ([ENG-0384](../decisions/ENG-0384-harness-config-lives-in-the-user-directory.md)), not beside this file. Its marked shared-conventions and skills block is projected from this baseline, pointing agents to the org-wide conventions, shared skills index, SOPs, and ENG records rather than copying them. Repo-specific context remains outside that block. |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | May be a pointer stub into `docs/` (the photos pattern). |
| `.github/CODEOWNERS` | Minimum: `* @qwts` plus explicit `/.github/` ownership. |
| Feature issue template | The shared [feature-lifecycle](feature-lifecycle.md) form ([ENG-0007](../decisions/ENG-0007-feature-lifecycle-convention.md)); repos may add fields, not drop sections. |
| `.prettierignore` | Repository-owned rules plus the marked governance block, which exempts the managed harness files from consumer formatters while preserving every local rule outside it. |

## Required when applicable

| File | Trigger |
| --- | --- |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | The repo cuts versions/releases. |
| `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` | The repo distributes bundled third-party code. Use this exact name in new repos (existing `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt` in image-trail is a recorded delta, not a pattern to copy). |
| Design docs | Anything beyond a trivial tool: `DESIGN.md` for small repos, `docs/design/` or `design/` for large ones. Location is free; existence is not. |
| `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` | Only when the repo needs more than the org default (gates, coverage maps); otherwise inherit. |

## Inherited from `qwts/.github` (do not copy into repos)

`SECURITY.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, and the default PR template are served
automatically to any repo that lacks its own. A repo adds a local copy only
as a deliberate delta (e.g. photos' gate-specific PR template) — never as a
duplicate of the default.

## Repo-side settings that accompany the files

Private vulnerability reporting **enabled** (SECURITY.md depends on it);
secret scanning + push protection and Dependabot security updates **on**
(the ENG-0005 baseline); CodeQL **on** once the repo has code. Private
repositories skip vulnerability reporting and CodeQL: a personal account
cannot enable either there, and governed CI skips the CodeQL lane while the
repository is private ([#355](https://github.com/qwts/agent-sop/issues/355)). Configure the
repository Actions Policy and CI/branch-protection settings from the shared
[CI execution policy](https://github.com/qwts/qwts-agent-ci/blob/3a5617b287d922e37f262210a1d8750d8217b56d/docs/ci-execution-policy.md). Use CodeQL advanced
setup so the same coverage runs through governed CI; default setup's internal
actor cannot be selected in the restricted-actor policy. Keep the default
workflow token read-only and disable GitHub Actions PR creation/approval unless
the repository records a reviewed exception; privileged PR writes use an
authorized App identity. Select the native queue for organization-owned repos
or the strict governed-updater fallback for user-owned repos without changing
the repository's enabled merge methods.

## Changelog

- 2026-09-24 — drop `.codex/` and `.claude/settings.json` from the required
  set. Harness config lives in the user directory
  ([ENG-0384](../decisions/ENG-0384-harness-config-lives-in-the-user-directory.md)).
- 2026-09-15 — retire the push lanes (qwts/agent-sop#371): nothing is
  synchronized into repositories any more, so the `.prettierignore` row no
  longer claims a sync or a `lint:synced` gate.
- 2026-09-15 — retire the remaining guard implementation and empty Copilot
  adapter (agent-sop discussion #370); keep downstream removal paths
  and identity-hook coverage.
- 2026-09-14 — private repositories skip vulnerability reporting and CodeQL;
  governed CI skips the CodeQL lane while private (#355).
- 2026-08-27 — retract the machine memory guard from the synced baseline
  (#331): ENG-0138 is still Proposed, and only accepted decisions ship. The
  guard files move to the retired inventory so the sync deletes consumer
  copies, and the harness adapters no longer register the guard hook.
- 2026-08-18 — compose a governed formatter-exemption block into every
  consumer's `.prettierignore`; canonical harness validation stays upstream.
- 2026-08-16 — ship uninstalled identity adapters (default unmanaged
  principal `ai9d`) next to the memory guard and WorktreeCreate hook.
- 2026-08-05 — make the shared agent-context discovery block status-aware,
  reconciled, and required before an onboarding repository can graduate.
- 2026-08-05 — require the baseline agent context to point agents to the
  org-wide conventions, shared skills index, SOPs, and ENG records before
  creating a repo-local skill.
- 2026-08-01 — point the governed Claude hook at the standalone agent identity
  runtime while retaining the integration contract in this baseline.
- 2026-08-01 — record the user-owned updater fallback, App-authored PR writes,
  read-only token default, and merge-method preservation.
- 2026-07-31 — require CodeQL advanced setup with the restricted-actor Actions
  Policy while preserving the existing security baseline.
- 2026-07-31 — add the Actions Policy and lifecycle-aware CI settings baseline.
- 2026-07-22 — initial version, from the basic-docs audit following PR #8.
- 2026-07-22 — point the feature-template row at the new [feature-lifecycle SOP](feature-lifecycle.md) (playbook#9).
- 2026-07-25 — add the shared `.codex/` project environment to the reconciled baseline.
- 2026-07-25 — add the shared `.claude/settings.json` harness config to the reconciled baseline.
