# Agent bot identity governance

The `qwts` organization uses one GitHub App per agent so bot-authored pull
requests remain eligible for the human approval required by the
[branch, PR, and review SOP](../sop/branch-pr-review.md). This repository owns
the roster and policy; the standalone
[`agent-bot-identity`](https://github.com/qwts/agent-bot-identity/tree/9ff7ce00b6a6945c7f249cf7a6ebf37cf58e86ee)
repository owns runtime code, installation, hooks, token minting, and
troubleshooting ([ENG-0128](../decisions/ENG-0128-agent-bot-runtime-ownership.md)).

## Organization identity model

- Every independently attributable agent has its own App; the active roster
  is **harness-level** — one App per harness, no active model-level
  identities ([ENG-0339](../decisions/ENG-0339-os-account-determines-persona.md)).
- Resolution picks the harness's default App, with macOS account name as the
  fallback detection input. A worktree pin
  ([ENG-0079](../decisions/ENG-0079-per-agent-identity.md)) remains the
  explicit override but must name an active App: reactivating a retired
  slug means restoring its row, App, and installations, not pinning it.
- Agents use short-lived installation tokens; humans never author through an
  agent App, and agent Apps never approve pull requests.
- Bot territory is the harness's macOS account, not a directory; worktrees
  are layout only, with no enforcement (ENG-0339 supersedes ENG-0045).
- Conversation-level Agent IDs add audit provenance without granting authority
  ([ENG-0081](../decisions/ENG-0081-transcript-bound-agent-execution-identities.md)).

## Roster

[`governance/agents.json`](https://github.com/qwts/qwts-agent-org/blob/18ce9fd3d8d4df20e3846eb7c59c42e464a7cf9f/governance/agents.json) in `qwts-agent-org` is the source of
truth. Drift validates every active App against every active and onboarding
governed repository; retired identities keep their rows but leave the active
set.

Current active identities — one per harness
([ENG-0339](../decisions/ENG-0339-os-account-determines-persona.md): the
harness-level slug is also the macOS agent account name):

- Established: `qwts-claude-agent` (Claude Code), `qwts-codex-agent` (Codex),
  `qwts-copilot-agent`, `qwts-cursor-agent`, `qwts-devin-agent`, and
  `qwts-muse-agent`.
- Fleet expansion (2026-09-01; Apps created and installed fleet-wide):
  `qwts-antigravity-agent`,
  `qwts-cline-agent`, `qwts-deepseek-agent`, `qwts-droid-agent`
  (factory-droid), `qwts-goose-agent`, `qwts-hermes-agent`,
  `qwts-kiro-agent`, `qwts-opencode-agent`, `qwts-pi-agent`,
  `qwts-qwen-agent` (qwen-code), `qwts-warp-agent`, `qwts-zcode-agent`,
  `qwts-amp-agent`, and `qwts-aider-agent`.
- Added 2026-09-02: `qwts-grok-agent` (Grok Build).

Retired 2026-09-01 with the move to harness-level identity (rows kept —
offboarding, not deletion): `qwts-claude-fable-agent`,
`qwts-claude-haiku-agent`, `qwts-claude-opus-agent`,
`qwts-claude-sonnet-agent`, `qwts-codex-luna-agent`, `qwts-codex-sol-agent`,
`qwts-codex-terra-agent`, and `qwts-vscode-agent`.

Adding an App requires one roster row with its exact slug, harness, and active
status. Removing access means retiring the row, revoking or narrowing the App,
and verifying drift; never delete history to hide a former identity.

## Permissions and installation coverage

Each App is owned by `qwts`, installed only on selected repositories, and has:

- Contents: read and write.
- Pull requests: read and write.
- Issues: read and write.
- Metadata: read.

No App receives approval authority, org-wide installation, user-to-server
OAuth, or unrelated permissions. Every active App must be installed on every
active and onboarding repository in [`governance/repos.json`](https://github.com/qwts/qwts-agent-org/blob/18ce9fd3d8d4df20e3846eb7c59c42e464a7cf9f/governance/repos.json); a narrower scope
is drift, not a per-agent exception.

## Runtime contract

Governed integrations invoke the installed executable by name or through an
explicit `AGENT_BOT_BIN` override. They never import runtime modules or depend
on a clone path. The stable contracts used here are:

```text
agent-bot setup-worktree
agent-bot mint-token --app <slug> --json
agent-bot claude-worktree-create
agent-bot doctor
```

The mint command's stdout is a credential and must be parsed without logging.
Missing executables, nonzero exits, malformed JSON, and missing tokens fail
closed. Installation and CLI details are in the pinned standalone
[README](https://github.com/qwts/agent-bot-identity/blob/9ff7ce00b6a6945c7f249cf7a6ebf37cf58e86ee/README.md).
