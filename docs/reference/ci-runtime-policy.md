# CI runtime budgets

Operational contract for the two runtime boundaries required by
[ENG-0267](../decisions/ENG-0267-bounded-ci-runtime.md). The owning lifecycle
and exact-SHA evidence rules remain in the
[CI execution policy](ci-execution-policy.md).

## Whole-job backstop

Every job that declares `runs-on` also declares a literal, reviewed
`timeout-minutes`. Reusable-workflow calls have no caller-side timeout field;
each runner job in the called workflow owns its finite limit.

Policy, evidence, and stable-gate jobs normally use short limits. Test, build,
CodeQL, release, and packaging jobs use limits measured from their cold runtime
with explicit headroom. Repository-specific numeric budgets are valid deltas.
No lane is unlimited merely because its runtime varies.

## External setup deadline

The job limit is the final backstop, not the diagnostic boundary. External
dependency and tool setup uses the shared `bounded-command` action from
`agent-sop`, pinned by immutable commit SHA in consumers. It:

- launches an explicit executable and JSON arguments without a shell;
- maps Windows `npm`/`npm.cmd` launchers to the active Node distribution's
  `npm-cli.js`, because command scripts require `cmd.exe`, while preserving the
  shell-free literal-argument boundary;
- applies a per-attempt deadline, finite attempt count, and finite retry delay;
- captures and terminates the process tree, including POSIX descendants that
  detach into another process group or session; and
- reports the task, attempt, elapsed time, deadline, and stable classification.

A dependency stall therefore fails at the named setup step in minutes instead
of consuming the whole job budget. Callers pass no secret through an argument;
the action does not print arguments or the environment.

```yaml
- name: Install locked dependencies
  uses: qwts/qwts-agent-sop/.github/actions/bounded-command@<reviewed-sha>
  with:
    task: Install locked dependencies
    executable: npm
    arguments-json: '["ci"]'
    timeout-seconds: '300'
    attempts: '2'
    retry-delay-seconds: '5'
```

## Enforcement and exceptions

The shared runtime checker rejects runner jobs without a literal limit and
known dependency installers invoked raw from workflow `run` steps. A necessary
exception remains genuinely bounded and records an owner, maximum duration,
review trigger, and reason beside the command:

```yaml
# ci-runtime: exception owner=release max=10m review=tool-change reason=upstream-installer-owns-cleanup
timeout --kill-after=10s 600s tool install
```

The checker reconstructs backslash-continued shell commands before inspection
and parses the GNU `timeout` option operands separately from its deadline
operand. Unitless deadlines are seconds. It verifies that the enforced timeout
does not exceed the declared maximum; an annotation alone waives nothing.
Exceptions are for bootstrap or platform constraints, not convenience.
Synthetic hung-process tests and workflow fixtures gate changes to the shared
runner and checker.

## Envelope-versus-job arithmetic

A bounded envelope must fail at its own step, inside documented headroom —
never by tripping the job wall, which cancels the job and skips
`!cancelled()`-gated report uploads. The checker therefore sums, for every job
that calls `bounded-command` or `bounded-dependency-install`, the worst case of
each envelope — `attempts × (timeout-seconds + termination-grace-seconds)` plus
`(attempts − 1) × retry-delay-seconds` — together with the literal
`timeout-minutes` of the job's other steps. That sum plus 60 seconds of
headroom for checkout, setup, cache custody checks, and save (the
[ENG-0269](../decisions/ENG-0269-trusted-dependency-reuse.md) enclosure rule)
must fit inside the job's `timeout-minutes`. Envelope inputs and sibling step
timeouts must be literal integers; an expression fails closed because the
arithmetic cannot be verified.

## Fan-out backpressure

A deadline bounds one stalled install; it does not stop a `main` push from
starting O(open PRs) of them at once. Every job that runs
`bounded-dependency-install` therefore declares job-level `concurrency`
([ENG-0313](../decisions/ENG-0313-ci-fan-out-backpressure.md)):

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' && 'ci-install-full' || format('ci-install-full-{0}', github.run_id) }}
  cancel-in-progress: false
```

Pull-request lanes share one repository-wide group per lane, so at most one
identical install sequence is in flight — merge-one-and-wait. Runs carrying
exact-SHA evidence (`push`, `merge_group`, `workflow_dispatch`) take the
per-run group and are never superseded by pull-request traffic. The checker
rejects a missing group, a `cancel-in-progress` that is not literally `false`,
and a group whose `github.run_id` escape is not inside an evaluated `${{ }}`
expression — a comment, a constant, or a quoted string literal naming it is not
an escape. It verifies that the escape exists, not that its condition is right,
so the expression is still reviewed. Group
names are repository deltas. GitHub keeps one pending run per group, so a
superseded pull-request lane goes red and re-runs on its next head — never
counted as validated.

Dependency download reuse is layered around the same bounded cold path by the
[dependency reuse policy](dependency-reuse-policy.md); a cache hit never removes
the installer deadline or lockfile verification.
