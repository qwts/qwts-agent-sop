# Governed repositories

The single source of truth for **which repositories this playbook governs** is
the manifest [`governance/repos.json`](../../governance/repos.json). This page is
its human-readable view: the table below is generated from that manifest by
[`tools/repos/repos.mjs`](../../tools/repos/repos.mjs) and gated in CI, so the
list can never silently drift from the machine-readable record the way the older
scattered prose did.

## How scope works

Governance is **inherit-by-default** ([ENG-0008](../decisions/ENG-0008-shared-sop-inheritance.md)):
a repository under the `qwts` account follows the shared baselines the moment it
exists — silence means baseline, not exemption. The manifest does **not** change
that. It is a *registry* of the governed universe with per-repo metadata
(visibility, shared-CI adoption, and each repo's recorded delta), **not** an
allowlist that a repo must appear in to be governed. A new `qwts` repo is
governed on day one; the rule this page adds is only that it must also be
*recorded* here, so the set is knowable in one place.

Removing a repo is therefore an act of **offboarding**, not deletion: a repo that
leaves the account or is retired keeps its row with `status: retired`, so the
record of what was once governed survives — the same supersede-don't-erase
discipline the [ENG series](../decisions/README.md) uses for decisions.

## How to add or remove a repo

Every operation is a manifest edit followed by a regenerate. Never edit the
generated table below by hand.

1. **Edit** [`governance/repos.json`](../../governance/repos.json):
   - **Onboard** — add a repo object with `status: "onboarding"` while it aligns
     to the baselines, then flip it to `"active"` once it conforms.
   - **Offboard** — flip the repo's `status` to `"retired"`; do not remove the row.
   - **Record a variance** — put the one-line difference in the repo's `delta`.
2. **Regenerate** the table: `node tools/repos/repos.mjs --write`.
3. **Verify**: `node tools/repos/repos.mjs check` passes (CI runs the same check;
   an un-regenerated edit fails it).
4. **Commit** the manifest and this doc together in the same PR.

### Manifest fields

- `name` — the repository name under the `qwts` account (unique).
- `visibility` — `public` or `private`.
- `status` — `active`, `onboarding`, or `retired`.
- `sharedCi` — whether the repo consumes the reusable docs-governance workflow
  (`.github/workflows/docs-governance.yml`) at `@v1`.
- `codexSync` — optional exceptions to the managed harness baseline (`.codex/`
  and `.claude/settings.json`; the field keeps its original name). Set
  `enabled: false` to skip a repository, or list managed paths under
  `exclude`. A repository that owns generated entries inside a managed JSON
  hook adapter declares their stable markers under
  `preserveJsonArrayEntries`. Composition is restricted to
  `.claude/settings.json`, `.codex/hooks.json`, and `.cursor/hooks.json`;
  synchronization composes those entries as data and never executes target
  code. Other paths, empty markers, and duplicates fail validation.
- `delta` — the one-line variance this repo carries from the shared baseline, or
  empty for a pure consumer. Deltas are surveyed in
  [the SOP inventory](../sop/inventory.md).
- `note` — optional free-text context.

## Operations

Cloning, drift detection, reconciliation, and harness synchronization are in
[governed repository operations](governed-repos-operations.md).
