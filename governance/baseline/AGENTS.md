# AGENTS.md

Canonical, vendor-neutral agent context for this repository, per
[ENG-0006](https://github.com/qwts/qwts-agent-sop/blob/main/docs/decisions/ENG-0006-agentic-primitives-governance.md).
Vendor-specific files (Copilot instructions, Cursor rules, and similar) are
thin adapters onto this file — they never restate what is here.

## Shared agent conventions and skills

PR-first workflow, validation-before-push, commit and PR hygiene, and the
untrusted-input threat model are defined once, for every repo, in the
[org-wide agent conventions](https://github.com/qwts/qwts-agent-sop/blob/main/docs/reference/agent-conventions.md).
Before creating or copying a repo-local skill, consult the reviewed
[shared agent skills](https://github.com/qwts/qwts-agent-sop/blob/74e775ef23d8e7d8f8e693ccc2329f430978c096/skills/README.md)
index. Reuse only the pinned version supplied by the governed harness; a skill
genuinely specific to this repository belongs in its local context.
This repository is governed by
[qwts-agent-sop](https://github.com/qwts/qwts-agent-sop) — its
[shared SOPs](https://github.com/qwts/qwts-agent-sop/blob/main/docs/sop/README.md)
and [engineering decisions](https://github.com/qwts/qwts-agent-sop/blob/main/docs/decisions/README.md)
apply here by default
([ENG-0008](https://github.com/qwts/qwts-agent-sop/blob/main/docs/decisions/ENG-0008-shared-sop-inheritance.md):
inherit by default, vary by explicit delta).
