# Shared agent skills

The fleet's skills home, per
[ENG-0004](../docs/decisions/ENG-0004-centralize-shared-cicd.md) — no per-repo
copies. Skills are agent primitives under
[ENG-0006](../docs/decisions/ENG-0006-agentic-primitives-governance.md): read as
directives, shipped with executable scripts, reviewed as code, and owned in
`.github/CODEOWNERS`. A skill listed here either lives in this repo under
`skills/<name>/` or lives in the repo that owns its domain and is cataloged
here by link — never copied into this tree.

## Available skills

- [agent-bot](https://github.com/qwts/agent-bot-identity/tree/28b5ee1be2f12dcf548d96309d21c4a1c8ad2b9d/skills/agent-bot)
  — owned by
  [qwts/agent-bot-identity](https://github.com/qwts/agent-bot-identity).
  Per-harness GitHub App identities for coding agents: bootstrap and
  installation, bot credential minting, authorized secure-store reads,
  GitHub-verified bot commits, transcript-bound Agent IDs, and Agent Spaces.
  Absorbed the old signed-commit skill (`signed-commit.mjs`). Install per its
  `SKILL.md`.
- [managed-machine](https://github.com/qwts/managed-machine/blob/v0.3.19/skills/SKILL.md)
  v0.3.19 — owned by
  [qwts/managed-machine](https://github.com/qwts/managed-machine). Bootstrap,
  update, and manage a Mac via the `managed-machine` Homebrew formula: fresh
  setup, version reporting, setup scripts, brew ownership fixes, fleet SSH
   keys, gitleaks hooks, and agent-CLI installs. Install per its `SKILL.md`.
- [add-zsh-function](https://github.com/qwts/zsh-functions/tree/main/skills/add-zsh-function)
  — owned by
  [qwts/zsh-functions](https://github.com/qwts/zsh-functions).
  Author a new zsh function: `functions/<name>` per that repo's `AGENTS.md`,
  reuse of the shared PATH/fpath API catalog, formula and `v*` tag release.
  Install per its `SKILL.md`.
- [migrate-to-zsh-functions](https://github.com/qwts/zsh-functions/tree/main/skills/migrate-to-zsh-functions)
  — owned by
  [qwts/zsh-functions](https://github.com/qwts/zsh-functions).
  Convert legacy `~/.functions` loops, vendor PATH leaks, and unguarded
  `export PATH` lines into guarded `BEGIN/END zsh-functions` blocks plus API
  calls. Install per its `SKILL.md`.
- [audit-shell-writers](https://github.com/qwts/zsh-functions/tree/main/skills/audit-shell-writers)
  — owned by
  [qwts/zsh-functions](https://github.com/qwts/zsh-functions).
  Read-only recon of who writes `.zshenv`/`.zprofile`/`.zshrc` across repos;
  run before migrating. Install per its `SKILL.md`.

The signed-commit skill previously lived here. A machine that installed it
from this repo has a dangling symlink; remove it:

```bash
rm -f ~/.claude/skills/signed-commit
```

## Installing

Externally owned skills install per the instructions in their own repo's
`SKILL.md`, linked above.

Skills that live in this repo follow one shape — each skill's `SKILL.md`
carries its own install line, symlinking the skill directory into the harness
so a `git pull` here updates every machine, rather than copying and drifting:

```bash
PLAYBOOK_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
ln -sfn "$PLAYBOOK_ROOT/skills/<name>" ~/.claude/skills/<name>
```

Distribution is manual today. Automating it — a worktree-create step, or a
plugin marketplace — waits until there are enough shared skills to justify the
machinery; the second skill added here is the signal that the manual step has
become the problem.

## Adding a skill

1. `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with `name` and `description` frontmatter. The
   description is always in an agent's context while the body loads only when
   relevant, so it must say *when to use this* — that string is the whole
   trigger (ENG-0006 progressive disclosure).
2. Link it from **Available skills** above. `docs-gov` fails a skill reachable
   from no index: guidance nothing links to is guidance no agent loads.
3. Keep it under the `perDoc` token budget. A skill that needs more is usually
   two skills.
4. State what an agent cannot derive from the code or existing docs, and link
   rather than restate — a shared fact in two agent files is a bug
   (ENG-0006 item 1).
5. Treat any script it ships as the supply chain it is: no secrets, no network
   fetch of unpinned code, least privilege.
