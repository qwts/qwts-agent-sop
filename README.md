# qwts-agent-sop

The organization-specific home for `qwts` engineering decisions, SOPs, fleet governance, shared CI, and agent-harness tooling. Imported from [agent-sop](https://github.com/qwts/agent-sop) with its existing Git history and `v1` tag preserved.

[Agent SOP](https://agentsop.ai) is the shared framework; this repository supplies the procedures selected by the `qwts` organization. See the [repository migration contract](docs/reference/repository-migration.md) for source ownership, compatibility, and historical references.

It is also the home for **cross-repo engineering decisions** — see the [decision index](docs/decisions/README.md) — and for the org-wide agent conventions every repo's [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) points to; see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for this repo's own agent context.

## Engineering decisions (ENG series)

Durable records for decisions that span more than one repository: tooling
direction, shared conventions, where things live, language and platform choices.

### 📐 [Decision index](docs/decisions/README.md)

Decisions owned by a single repository stay in that repository. The routing test
is simple: **if exactly one repo would have to change, it is not an ENG record.**

## Documentation Structure

The `docs/` folder contains 22 comprehensive guides covering the complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), organized by phase:

- [Decommissioning & Retirement](docs/22-decommissioning_and_retirement.md)

Each document includes navigation links, prerequisites, and cross-references to related topics. Use these guides to align on best practices, ensure consistency, and drive quality in your projects.

## Shared standards and tooling

- [Governed repositories](docs/reference/governed-repos.md) — which repos this playbook governs, and how to add or remove one; generated from the `governance/repos.json` manifest (ENG-0011).
- [Governed repository operations](docs/reference/governed-repos-operations.md) — the lanes you run against those repos: local bootstrap, drift detection, reconciliation, and harness synchronization.
- [Shared SOPs](docs/sop/README.md) — org-wide standard operating procedures for how work moves, inherited by every repo (ENG-0008).
- [Org-wide agent conventions](docs/reference/agent-conventions.md) — the shared agent working agreement every repo's `AGENTS.md` links to (ENG-0006).
- [Agent bot identity governance](docs/reference/agent-bot-identity.md) — the qwts App roster, permissions, coverage, and integration contract (ENG-0016, ENG-0128).
- [Agent bot organization operations](docs/reference/agent-bot-operations.md) — registration, verification, and incident expectations without duplicating the standalone runtime.
- [Agent execution identity policy](docs/reference/agent-execution-identity.md) — the private transcript-bound identity and audit boundary behind each agent conversation (ENG-0081).
- [Agentic primitives conformance checklist](docs/reference/agentic-primitives-conformance-checklist.md) — the ENG-0006 §6 checklist per-repo alignment issues link to.
- [Machine memory guard retirement](docs/reference/agent-memory-guard.md) — historical decision and source; the implementation and dormant backlog are retired.
- [Shared agent skills](skills/README.md) — skills centralized here and installed into every agent harness, rather than copied per repo (ENG-0004, ENG-0006).
- [Documentation governance](docs/reference/documentation-governance.md) — the `docs-gov` gate: deterministic checks that keep docs agent-readable, consumable by other repos as a reusable workflow.
- [CI execution policy](docs/reference/ci-execution-policy.md) — lifecycle scheduling and deduplication without removing agreed validation gates.
- [Governed CI rollout checklist](docs/reference/governed-ci-rollout.md) — exact-SHA rollout evidence, user-owned fallback, check publishers, credentials, and manual settings.
- [Release-lifecycle fleet handoff](docs/reference/governed-ci-release-lifecycle-fleet.md) — manifest-wide release mechanism inventory, generated-projection identities, and executable repair or verified dispositions.
- [Dependency & tooling inventory](docs/reference/dependency-inventory.md) — the report-only inventory of dependencies, licenses, and tooling across governed repos, consumed as a reusable workflow (ENG-0015).
- [Semantic ratchets](docs/reference/semantic-ratchets.md) — combine deterministic size ratchets with calibrated semantic screening and rare authoritative exception adjudication (ENG-0160).
- [Documentation style guide](docs/23-documentation_style_guide.md) — conventions for writing docs in this playbook.
- [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) — how changes to this repository land.
